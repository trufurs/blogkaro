        <p>Canva is a popular graphic design platform that offers a simple user interface and a slew of features. Whether it's a poster, social media post, or a YouTube thumbnail, you can design just about anything and everything with Canva. It has many handy tools that can make designing easy and convenient.

            <p><strong>1. Choose a Trending Style</strong><br>
                If you are confused about choosing the right color combination and fonts for your design, you can try one of Canva's premade styles. It offers trending font combinations and color palettes to make your designs stand out.

                To do so, head over to the Styles tab on the left sidebar menu, and select any one of the styles you like.

                You can select All to apply a combination of fonts and color palettes to your design, or you can try them separately in Colors and Fonts.

            <p><strong>2. Use Frames to Crop Images Into Shapes</strong>
                <br>
                Similar to what grids offer, you can use frames to crop images into shapes. To get started, you can scroll down to Frames, or search for â€œframes'' in Elements. After that, select one of them according to your preference.
                You can then upload a picture to Canva by clicking on Upload, or you can choose from one of the stock images available in the Photos section. While upgrading to Canva Pro gives you access to more stock photos, there are still many to choose from in the free version.
                When you have your image, drag and drop it into the frame you selected. You can enlarge the frame or reposition it as you please. 
                <br><br>
            <strong>3. Arranging and Grouping Elements</strong><br>
            There are times when you have to use a lot of elements in your design. So, it becomes important to layer them to create a well-designed template. Luckily, Canva lets you arrange them with just a few clicks.
            To do this, right-click on a particular element and select Send Backward or Bring Forward to layer it on top or behind other elements.
            Grouping is another way you can arrange elements. After selecting the elements you want to group, select Group on the toolbar above the editor, or use the Ctrl + G (Cmd + G on Mac) keyboard shortcut.
            By doing so, you will be able to edit, move, or copy multiple items at once. Similarly, you can ungroup the elements after you are done with your design. 
            <br><br>
        <strong>4. Lock the Position of Elements <br></strong>
            Another Canva feature that comes in handy when dealing with a lot of elements is the Lock tool. As the name suggests, it allows you to lock the position of elements on your design to avoid making any unintentional changes.

            To do so, select the element you want to lock in, and then click the Lock icon on the top-right corner of the toolbar above the editor. You can also select multiple elements to lock by holding Shift on your keyboard, and then hitting the Lock icon.
            Similarly, you can click the icon again to unlock the selected elements. </p>
            <br><br>
        <p>  
        <strong>5. Set the Transparency of Elements <br></strong>
                You can enhance your design by adjusting the transparency of any element on Canva. This technique can help you achieve the desired opacity of an element and create an eye-catching design.
            </p></strong>
            <p>Hope it improves you in canvas designing</p>
