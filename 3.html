        <p><strong>Wall Decor Ideas</strong><br>
            You have finally put together your beloved home, complete with all precious pieces that brighten your day! All that’s left is a large wall staring blankly at you. A real Catch-22 for the homeowner. But we’ve got you covered! An empty wall can be the start of something new.
            
            A new leaf to turn over. Designing an art wall is much more than turning it into a photo gallery. There are tons of tactics and wall decor ideas to make the wall totally you. We list below 20 foolproof ways to turn that vacuum into the X-factor of your home! </p>
        <br><br>
            <p><strong>1. Statement Art</strong><br>
                Any room can benefit from the gravitational pull of large artwork. It gives a crisp, balanced focal point to the room without detracting from the rest of the room.
                
                The larger your piece, the more graphic aplomb and conversation it will incorporate into the room.
                
                Anything from an oversized photograph or painting hung at eye level will give maximum impact.
                
                Maybe you can even try minimal, DIY abstract artwork by yourself. Abstract minimalism is reasonably easy to master with simple shapes and color palettes.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Laquered Walls</strong><br>
                They are ultra-glossy. They are vivacious. They are Hollywood glamor rolled right into your home. They are lacquered walls!
                
                Oozing with opulence, they will stop your guests in their tracks!
                
                However, surprisingly easy and inexpensive to attain, lacquered paint colors are great for dark walls to reflect light off chandeliers, pendants, and candles!
                
                While reds are loud and traditional, intense blues and greens lacquered wall space will carry a magical, wistful air. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>3. Architectural Accent Wall</strong><br>
                Placed on a white wall, distinguished architectural elements can instantly steal attention.
                
                Delicate details of flora, fauna, motifs, and folklore extracts are painstakingly etched onto doors, windows, and wooden panels in Burma, India, Indonesia, Morocco, and Turkey, to name a few.
                
                A single piece of this traditional, big personality art can extend an antique grandeur to your blank wall.
                
                They work exceptionally well as backdrops to dining rooms, living room walls, and headboards above beds.

                <br><br>
                <strong>4. Woven Baskets Wall Decor Idea</strong><br>
                Aesthetically striking, with natural textures and multidimensional weaves, baskets are having a moment in the pandemic.

                Made of reed, jute, cane, palm leaves, and grass, this design idea is the perfect blend of minimal and exotic. Sun swirl, for instance, are baskets made out of banana stalk and raffia. Additionally, at Ten Thousand Villages, Uganda Baskets has a heartwarming practice of letting know who exactly wove your baskets for you!</p>
            <br>    <br>
            <p><strong>5. Mirror</strong><br>
                While we love free-standing large mirrors that enlarge small spaces, we are talking about upping the game here.
                
                Venetian to bronze marbled, Azzurro, and mottled- antique mirrors are back in action and here to stay! Their fragile, romantic patina fascinates the viewer through hazy, mystic reflections.
                
                Opt for a minimal fringe or an intricate frame; either way, we recommend propping them up against the wall for the right amount of flair. 
            <br><br>
            <strong> Ending Note </strong><br>
            In conclusion, don’t be afraid to go big and bold with different decorating styles. Whether your wall sees a fearless large-scale art or stays naked, make sure it reflects your personal style and brings you joy!

                After all, sometimes, it is aught for everything! But, if you want to know how the wind blows, pop over to Foyr Neo and start building your 3D dream wall before tackling the real-life one</p>
